## How to add your own project

1. Copy this file (or any project in `projects/`) and rename it (e.g. `my-project.qmd`).
2. Edit the YAML: `title`, `description`, `date`, `author`, and optional `image`, `categories`.
3. Write your narrative below. No code runs — everything is static HTML.

## Example: static code block (display only)

You can show code for readers without executing it. Use plain fenced code blocks:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
df.plot(kind="bar")
```

```r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data, aes(x = year, y = value)) + geom_line()
```

## Linking to live work

- **GitHub:** Link to a repo or notebook, e.g. `[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/you/repo)`.
- **Observable / Colab / Binder:** Paste the link and a short description.
- **Screenshots:** Add images to `images/` and reference them with `![alt](images/name.png)`.

No R or Python installation is required to build this site — just run `quarto render` and the Projects page will be plain HTML.
