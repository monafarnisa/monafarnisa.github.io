## Overview

My research in [The Sustainable Horticulture Lab](https://naes.unr.edu/barrios/default.aspx) at the University of Nevada, Reno focused on plant–environment interactions and fertilization effects on floral hemp under field conditions in the high desert.

## Methods

- Field trials with varying nitrogen regimes
- Yield and quality metrics
- Statistical modeling (R)
