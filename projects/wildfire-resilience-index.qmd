## Overview

At the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), I worked as a geospatial analyst on the [Wildfire Resilience Index](https://wildfireindex.org/), integrating nearly 100 geospatial data layers across multiple domains.

## Domains

- **Infrastructure** — exposure and capacity
- **Health** — population and vulnerability
- **Vegetation & species** — fuels and biodiversity
- **Air & water** — quality and availability
- **Cultural heritage** — nationwide exposure (see Publications)

## Tools & methods

- R, Python, QGIS
- Spatial aggregation and weighting
- Deterministic and index-based modeling
