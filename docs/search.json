    "text": "Hello! My name is Mona. Welcome to my website!\nI am a geospatial data scientist & analyst with interests in static and interactive visualizations, predictive and deterministic model development, spatial statistics, command line coding, and remotely sensed data. With over five years of experience coding, I have gained a wealth of knowledge and am excited to branch out my data skills working with new datasets and developing my coding skills.\n\nMy most recent job as a geospatial analyst on the Wildfire Resilience Index at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis was an exciting project that encompassed working with almost 100 geospatial data layers across multiple social and ecological domains including infrastructure, health, vegetation, species, air, water, cultural heritage, and more.\n\nI have a Master of Science in Natural Resources and Environmental Science from the University of Nevada, Reno where I was part of The Sustainable Horticulture Lab. My research was on plant environment interactions, crop yield analytics, and fertilization tracking.\nI have a Bachelor of Science from Amsterdam University College in The Netherlands where I majored in Energy, Climate, and Sustainability.\n\nI have spent a lot of time conducting fieldwork, working on farms and am passionate about sustainable agriculture. In my free time I like to bike, surf, and sew."
