Hello! My name is Mona. Welcome to my website!

I am a geospatial data scientist & analyst with interests in static and interactive visualizations, predictive and deterministic model development, spatial statistics, command line coding, and remotely sensed data. With over five years of experience coding, I have gained a wealth of knowledge and am excited to branch out my data skills working with new datasets and developing my coding skills.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My most recent job as a geospatial analyst on the [Wildfire Resilience Index](https://wildfireindex.org/) at the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) was an exciting project that encompassed working with almost 100 geospatial data layers across multiple social and ecological domains including infrastructure, health, vegetation, species, air, water, cultural heritage, and more.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have a Master of Science in Natural Resources and Environmental Science from the University of Nevada, Reno where I was part of [The Sustainable Horticulture Lab](https://naes.unr.edu/barrios/default.aspx). My research was on plant environment interactions, crop yield analytics, and fertilization tracking.

I have a Bachelor of Science from Amsterdam University College in The Netherlands where I majored in Energy, Climate, and Sustainability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have spent a lot of time conducting fieldwork, working on farms and am passionate about sustainable agriculture. In my free time I like to bike, surf, and sew.
